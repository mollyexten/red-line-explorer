When I come back to this app, I should prioritize the following 
two pieces of functionality:

1. Redirecting user to station-specific page after making a contribute 
(I can use history.push() for this. I just need to figure out how to get 
the stationKebab so that I can set it as params)

2. Creating a modal (a pop up window, absolute positioning) for "review", 
which a user could then either edit (put request), cancel (delete request), 
or submit (post request)
