When I come back to this app, I can focus on the following:

1. Creating a modal (a pop up window, absolute positioning) for "review", 
which a user could then either edit (put request), cancel (delete request), 
or submit (post request)

2. Make p tags more formatted (grid? cards?)

3. Make recommendations appear from most recent to oldest

4. format form for large screens (more grid)

5. Introduce categories for posts - station info, nearby places, miscellaneous thoughts

6. Introduce "upvotes" to sort posts by popularity
