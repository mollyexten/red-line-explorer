When I come back to this app, I can focus on the following:

1. Redirecting user to station-specific page after making a contribute 
(I can use history.push() for this. I just need to figure out how to get 
the stationKebab so that I can set it as params)

2. Creating a modal (a pop up window, absolute positioning) for "review", 
which a user could then either edit (put request), cancel (delete request), 
or submit (post request)

3. Make p tags more formatted (grid? cards?)

4. Make recommendations appear from most recent to oldest

5. format form for large screens (more grid)

6. Introduce categories for posts - station info, nearby places, miscellaneous thoughts

7. Introduce "upvotes" to sort posts by popularity
