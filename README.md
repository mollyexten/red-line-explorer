# Red Line Explorer

deployed site here

## Project Description

Red Line Explorer is a mobile-first application made from Airtable and React in which the user is able to find and add interesting destinations near MBTA stations on the Red Line (Boston, MA). To find destinations, the user can select a station on the homepage, which takes them to a station page that lists interesting nearby places. The user can learn more about a specific location by clicking on its corresponding link. To add destinations, the user can submit a form with the necessary details about the point of interest. Finally, users can discover interesting places through the explore page, which randomly generates information about a destination.

## Wireframes

The wireframes depict the layout in a mobile view. The homepage, entitled "RED LINE EXPLORER" links to specific station pages, just called "STATION" in this example. The destinations will be clickable links that display more information about the destination (not shown in these wireframes). The form displays the view for users wishing to add a destination to a specific station. Finally, the "CATEGORIES" page displays destination for all stations under a specific category (food, shopping, or leisure)
