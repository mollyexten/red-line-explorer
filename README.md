deployed site here

## Project Description

Red Line Explorer is a mobile-first application made from Airtable and React in which the user is able to find things to do near MBTA stations on the Red Line (Boston, MA). From the homepage, the user can select a station page to find the beloved places, activities, and itineraries of others users. If a user is familiar with a particular station, they can contribute their own suggestions via a form.

## Wireframes

The wireframes depict the layout in a mobile view. The homepage, entitled "RED LINE EXPLORER" links to specific station pages, referred to as "STATION" in this example. Each station page will render user contributions. Also included are the form ("Share Your Experience") and the About page.
